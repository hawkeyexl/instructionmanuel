## Presentation style

My talks focus on practical, actionable strategies that attendees can implement immediately. I use real-world examples from working with documentation at scale, avoiding buzzwords in favor of concrete techniques and tools.

The tone is humble yet confidentâ€”sharing what works, what doesn't, and the lessons learned along the way. Presentations include:

- Live demonstrations when applicable
- Code examples and configuration samples
- Case studies from real implementations
- Q&A to address specific attendee challenges

Welcome to my portfolio and blog! I'm Manny Silva, a technical writer and engineer focused on making documentation resilient, testable, and reliable.

## What I Do

As Head of Documentation at Skyflow, I spend my time building tools and strategies that help documentation teams keep pace with rapid product changes. My work centers on a concept I call "Docs as Tests"—treating documentation like code that can be tested, validated, and integrated into development workflows.

## Why This Matters

Documentation breaks. It breaks often, and it breaks silently. A button gets renamed, an API endpoint changes, a workflow gets updated—and suddenly your carefully crafted docs are misleading users instead of helping them.

Traditional approaches to documentation quality don't scale. Manual review catches some issues, but it's time-consuming and error-prone. We need better tools and methods.

## What You'll Find Here

This site brings together my work on documentation testing and developer experience:

- **[Docs as Tests Book](/book)**: A comprehensive guide to implementing documentation testing
- **[Doc Detective](/doc-detective)**: An open-source framework for automated documentation validation
- **[Talks](/talks)**: Conference presentations on documentation, testing, and AI-driven content
- **Blog**: Practical insights, lessons learned, and strategies for building better documentation

## The Approach

My philosophy is straightforward: documentation should be treated like code. That means:

- **Version control**: Track changes and collaborate effectively
- **Testing**: Validate that instructions actually work
- **Automation**: Catch errors before users encounter them
- **CI/CD integration**: Make documentation quality part of your development pipeline

This isn't about perfection—it's about building systems that catch problems early and make maintenance sustainable.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in hearing from people working on documentation challenges. Whether you're implementing docs-as-tests strategies, building documentation tools, or just trying to keep your docs accurate:
